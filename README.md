Josephson junction and SQUID numerical simulations

Reproducing the Tesche-Clarke paper
Aim to produce numerical simulations for:
single quiet josephson junction
single noisy josephson junction
quiet SQUID no capacitance modeled
noisy SQUID no capacitance modeled
noisy SQUID with capacitance

Produce software to run sim as stand alone
